# Conway's Game of Life

My implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in Rust. Uses the `ggez` crate.

## Usage

You have a few options when starting up the game. You can just type `conway`, in which case a blank, paused grid will appear. You can click on this grid to draw what ever pattern of blocks you'd like, then press spacebar to run it.

Alternatively, if you type any one of the following keywords after `conway`, the game will launch in a preset starting position, that you can interact with as normal.

Type in the following keywords and see what happens!

- `gun`
- `glider`
- `exploder`
- `bar`
